Welcome! The Open Syllabus Project is an effort to see what can be learned by analyzing the contents of a corpus of over 1 million college course syllabi.  Here you'll find:

- The source code for the Open Syllabus Explorer web application.

- A set of generalized utilities for interacting with the corpus.

- Routines that extract information about citations, fields, institutions, and locations from the syllabi.

- A harness for parallelizing jobs across multiple EC2 instances. (It would take about a month to run the citation extraction job on your laptop!)

- Tools for analyzing the structure of the citation graph.

Unfortunately, we're unable publish the raw syllabi for copyright reasons. But, if you're interested in contributing to the project or working with the corpus, drop us a line at syllabusopen@gmail.com. We're actively looking to develop research collaborations around this data, and would love to hear about what you're working on.
