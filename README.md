# Open Syllabus Project

Welcome! The Open Syllabus Project is an effort to see what can be learned by analyzing the contents of a corpus of over 1 million college course syllabi.  Here you'll find:

- The source code for the Open Syllabus Explorer web application, an analytical interface onto the citation information extracted from the syllabi.

- A set of generalized utilities for interacting with the corpus.

- The routines that extract information about citations, fields, institutions, and locations from the syllabi.

- A harness for parallelizing jobs across multiple EC2 instances. It would take about a month to run the citation extraction job on your laptop :)

- Tools for building and rendering text co-assignment networks.

We unable publish the raw syllabi for copyright reasons, but, if you're interested in contributing to the project or working with the data, drop us a line at syllabusopen@gmail.com. We're actively looking to develop research collaborations around this data, and would love to chat!
